When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are ready to share your code with the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually gives you ultimate flexibility. For example you are working on a project with other team members
you don't want to pull in breaking changes. You want to pull in when you feel everything is right.
