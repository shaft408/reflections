When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are ready to share your code with the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually gives you ultimate flexibility. For example you are working on a project with other team members
you don't want to pull in breaking changes. You want to pull in when you feel everything is right.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
I can branch my own personal repository from Master branch
I can cone someones repository from git hub and make changes and push those changes back to the repository I cloned from
Fork is git gubs version of clone. It happens on git hub, changes made in a forked repository cannot be pushed back to where the repository was forked from.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I believe it makes merging up to git hub easier because you will be able to have a working copy of what's on git hub and work to resolve the conflicts localy
before pushing up to git hub
