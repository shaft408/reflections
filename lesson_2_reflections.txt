What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, you create a repository and you take into account what files it currently has,
and also a .get file is created containing information about the status of those files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different in that it is the last chance before the files get commited.
I'm assuming users have the options to remove files from the staging commit area but this hasn't been discussed yet.
The value it adds is that it gives users a last chance to add/remove to the final commit.
